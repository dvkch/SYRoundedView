A simple way to have rounded corners in your views

This library doesn't seem to have been used by anyone else but me so I'm moving it to my SYKit collection :) If you need this pod you can still use it, or move to SYKit for the Swift version. See you there !

Read the code, share it, update it, fork it, it's all yours now. 

Please don't open an issue.
