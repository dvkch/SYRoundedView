SYRoundedView
=============

A simple way to have rounded corners in your views

Semi-deprecated
==========

Though I converted this library to Swift recently, motly for the fun of it and my own OCD, I am not using it anymore and I don't think any other person does either. Though I'm not formally deprecating this lib, expect low to no support on it.
